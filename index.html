          Hello citizen! Prepare for a short glimpse into the life of me.

          I'm Josh and I enjoy coding in general, however my passion for Web Development is the strongest. All around the web I see broken features and I want to fix them, it's that which got me interested in programming again after a long time away. I have a basic grasp of the technologies and languages involved in Web Development, and strive to increase that knowledge every day.

          In my free time I like to support the local music scene by going out to shows around the county.Also I dig hiking the many outdoor areas around my hometown of Ramona. Other interests include gaming, failing to learn to play a wide variety of musical instruments, and singing actually not terribly. No really, I can sing pretty dandy and I'll belt it out pretty much anywhere.
